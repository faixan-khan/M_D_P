# MARKOV-DECISION-PROCESS

### Prerequisites
    python3
# PartA
    A program (in python) that performs ​ Value Iteration(VI) Algorithm on an
    input grid world as mentioned in pdf and outputs the utility map of the states
    after each iteration of the ​ VI algorithm ​ till convergence(along with the utility map
    after convergence). For convergence/termination, consider at most ​ 1% difference
    in each state utility between iterations. (​ Assume discount factor = 0.99​ )
**Output format**

    If the input grid world is of size ​ n x ​ m ​ , output should consist of ​ n lines, each having ​ m
    spaced values. Each value should be rounded off to 3 decimal positions.
    Example output format for a grid of size 3 x 2(for each iteration):
    5.223 4.667
    1.446 3.132
    9.636 8.312
    //new line after each iteration


# PartB
    VI algorithm with different Discount factor and Step Cost

# Part C
    MDP using LP
    Use the excel LP solver to compute the x values and the expected utilities for this
    MDP.Please verify that the expected utility obtained is equivalent to the one
    obtained using the VI algorithm.
